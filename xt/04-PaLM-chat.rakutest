# With PaLM we have to make the assignment:
#     $chat.system-role = $chat.assistant-role;
# because:
#
# 1. By default LLM::Functions::Chat has three different roles: <user assistant system>.
#    So, we get the error:
#      error => {code => 400, message => Messages must have 0 or at most 2 authors: 3 specified., status => INVALID_ARGUMENT}
#
# 2. With:
#      $chat.system-role = $chat.user-role;
#     we get the error:
#      error => {code => 400, message => Messages must alternate between authors., status => INVALID_ARGUMENT}
#
# 3. Hence we make the following assignment and change the prompt to use "This assistant is ..." instead of "You are ..."
